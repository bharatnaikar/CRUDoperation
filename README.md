# CRUD Operations in Java

## Overview
This is a Java-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations project that allows you to manage a list of students with details such as name, email, age, class, date of birth, gender, and address. The project uses a MySQL database to store the student data and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.

This project demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD operations using Java Swing for the user interface and JDBC for database interaction.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new student records.
- **Read**: View existing student records.
- **Update**: Edit existing student records.
- **Delete**: Remove student records.
- **Database**: Uses MySQL to store student information.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built using Java Swing components.
